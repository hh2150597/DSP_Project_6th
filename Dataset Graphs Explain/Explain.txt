As observed, our dataset consists of a total of 33 audio voices. To analyze them in our DSP project, we played each audio file one by one and generated corresponding graphs. Notably, the built-in voice in Matlab exhibits excellent clarity, so applying noise reduction techniques only has a minimal impact. However, when we recorded our own voice and subjected it to the same process, the background voices were not entirely eliminated. Fortunately, these residual background voices do not pose any issues for both normal and impaired individuals within the audible range. Nevertheless, amplification of our own voice also amplifies the background noise, as previously mentioned. It's worth noting that this does not affect the clarity of our own voice.
